## Why this matters
Sequencing tech has moved from research labs to everyday healthcare and consumer products. These companies show **four different go-to-market paths**:
- **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)** genomics and research partnerships  
- **Clinical precision-medicine platforms** (testing + data/software)  
- **Population genomics** for health systems and public health  
- **Multi-cancer early detection** blood tests seeking broad reimbursement

## Company deep dives

### 23andMe
**Founders**: Anne Wojcicki, Linda Avey, Paul Cusenza  
**Founded**: 2006  
**Initial investment**: Early Series A (2007) ≈ $9M; later rounds totaled hundreds of millions  
**Current revenue (recent FY)**: ≈ $220M range  
**Main focus**: DTC ancestry + health risk reports; large consent-based genetics database monetized via research/pharma partnerships  
**Future outlook**: DTC growth has slowed; under a pharma owner, expect a pivot toward **drug discovery/data** using the biobank (with strong emphasis on privacy/consent).

---

### Tempus (NASDAQ: TEM)
**Founder**: Eric Lefkofsky (with early scientific leadership by Kevin White)  
**Founded**: 2015; **IPO**: 2024  
**Funding before IPO**: ≈ $1.3B+ cumulatively  
**Current revenue (2024)**: ≈ $690M (Genomics + Data/Services)  
**Main focus**: **AI-enabled precision medicine**—oncology genomic tests + a clinical data platform (decision support, trial matching, and life-sciences data products)  
**Future outlook**: Strong position if it keeps scaling higher-margin **data/software** alongside testing, while navigating reimbursement and competition (Foundation Medicine, Guardant, hospital labs).

---

### Helix
**Founders**: James Lu, Justin Kao, Scott Burke  
**Founded**: 2015 (incubated with Illumina, Warburg Pincus, Sutter Hill)  
**Initial investment**: >$100M at launch; later $200M Series B (2018)  
**Current revenue**: Private company; commonly estimated **tens of millions** annually  
**Main focus**: **Population genomics** programs for health systems and states (clinical screening, pharmacogenomics, pathogen surveillance) delivered via an enterprise genomics platform  
**Future outlook**: Growth tied to **multi-year B2B contracts** and public-health budgets; success depends on embedding genomics in routine care and showing measurable outcomes.

---

### GRAIL
**Origin**: Spun out of Illumina in 2016 (re-separated from Illumina in 2024)  
**Early funding**: Series A >$100M; **Series B $1B (2017)**  
**Current revenue (2024)**: ≈ $100M+ Galleri® sales in the US  
**Main focus**: **Multi-cancer early detection (MCED)** via blood (Galleri test) for asymptomatic individuals; advancing clinical evidence and payer coverage  
**Future outlook**: Enormous TAM if MCED earns guideline inclusion + broad reimbursement; near-term growth via employer/self-pay and targeted Medicare pathways while pivotal outcomes data mature.
