###My First Blog

This is my first blog! c:

My name is Satvika Kodali and I'm currently majoring in biomedical engineering, graduating in 2029. 

My goal in life is to make an impact in the world, do something to help someone.

In my free time, I play electric guitar or play badminton with my friends and family. 

My favorite subject in college so far is Engineering Problem Solving!
