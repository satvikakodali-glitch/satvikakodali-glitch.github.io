## Company deep dives

### 23andMe
__Founders__: Anne Wojcicki, Linda Avey, Paul Cusenza  
__Founded__: 2006  
__Initial investment__: Early Series A (2007) = $9M; later rounds totaled hundreds of millions  
__Current revenue (recent FY)__: ≈ $220M range  
__Main focus__: DTC ancestry + health risk reports; large consent-based genetics database monetized via research/pharma partnerships  
__Future outlook__: DTC growth has slowed; under a pharma owner, expect a pivot toward drug discovery/data using the biobank (with strong emphasis on privacy/consent).

### Tempus (NASDAQ: TEM)
__Founder__: Eric Lefkofsky (with early scientific leadership by Kevin White)  
__Founded__: 2015; IPO: 2024  
__Funding before IPO__: $1.3B+ cumulatively  
__Current revenue (2024)__: ≈ $690M (Genomics + Data/Services)  
__Main focus__: AI-enabled precision medicine, oncology genomic tests + a clinical data platform (decision support, trial matching, and life-sciences data products)  
__Future outlook__: Strong position if it keeps scaling higher-margin data/software alongside testing, while navigating reimbursement and competition (Foundation Medicine, Guardant, hospital labs).

---

### Helix
__Founders__: James Lu, Justin Kao, Scott Burke  
__Founded__: 2015 (incubated with Illumina, Warburg Pincus, Sutter Hill)  
__Initial investment__: Greater than $100M at launch; later $200M Series B (2018)  
__Current revenue__: Private company; commonly estimated tens of millions annually  
__Main focus__: Population genomics programs for health systems and states (clinical screening, pharmacogenomics, pathogen surveillance) delivered via an enterprise genomics platform  
__Future outlook__: Growth tied to multi-year B2B contracts and public-health budgets; success depends on embedding genomics in routine care and showing measurable outcomes.

---

### GRAIL
__Origin__: Spun out of Illumina in 2016 (re-separated from Illumina in 2024)  
__Early funding__: Series A  greater than $100M; Series B $1B (2017)
__Current revenue (2024)__: ≈ $100M+ Galleri sales in the US  
__Main focus__: Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) via blood (Galleri test) for asymptomatic individuals; advancing clinical evidence and payer coverage  
__Future outlook__: Enormous TAM if MCED earns guideline inclusion + broad reimbursement; near-term growth via employer/self-pay and targeted Medicare pathways while pivotal outcomes data mature.
